# Study_Mitra 
AI Powered Lecture Intelligence Tool

An end-to-end **AI-powered system** that converts lecture videos/audio into **structured, searchable, and intelligent learning material**. This tool automatically transcribes lectures, generates summaries, extracts key concepts, enables question answering, and supports multilingual translation — all wrapped in an easy-to-use **Gradio web interface**.

---

## Problem Statement

Students and educators often struggle with:

* Long, unstructured lecture recordings
* Difficulty revising specific topics
* Language barriers
* Time-consuming manual note-making

This project solves these problems by transforming raw lecture media into **actionable academic intelligence**.

---

## Features

* Uses **Fast-Whisper** for high-speed, high-accuracy speech recognition
* Handles long lectures efficiently

### AI-Powered Summarization

* Generates **concise lecture summaries**
* Highlights key ideas and learning objectives
* Powered by **Transformer-based NLP models**

### Keyword & Topic Extraction

* Identifies **important concepts and keywords**
* Uses **spaCy NLP pipeline**
* Helps in fast revision and indexing

### Question Answering (Q&A)

* Ask questions directly from lecture content
* Context-aware answers generated using NLP models

### Translation Support

* Translate lecture transcripts into multiple languages
* Helpful for multilingual learners

### Interactive Web Interface

* Built using **Gradio**
* Upload lecture files and get results instantly
* No backend or server configuration required
